					<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">
					<b>-</b> Nestled in the heart of the city, offering breath-taking views of the runway from the largest rooms in the city, the hotel is a mere 10 minutes by road from the international airport. The cutting-edge corporate parks of Bandra-Kurla Complex along with the Bombay Exhibition Centre at Goregaon, are swiftly accessible from our 5 star hotel in Mumbai. While Andheri and Bandra, the two western suburbs that are pivotal to India’s film and fashion industry, can be reached just as quickly.<br><br>

					<b>-</b> Our luxury hotel near Mumbai domestic airport embodies the best aspects of Palatial and Art Deco design, both of which are recurrent architectural themes in Mumbai. And while neither of these styles has been overstated, neither has been underplayed either. Tradition and modernism intertwine, evident in the intricate details of its interiors at Taj Santacruz, Mumbai and this flavour extends itself to the culinary realms too.<br><br>

					<b>-</b> A feast for the senses awaits you in the atrium, where a six-story high piece of Thikri art changes colour with the sky’s ever-changing hues. Indulge in the rich medley of flavours and local specialties with organic twists prepared by our Chefs. An all-day dining destination at heart, Tiqri mirrors the soul of Mumbai street food, possesses the pulse of Maharashtrian cuisine and captures the global culinary journey on your plate. In its various avatars, Tiqri offers guests myriad experiences. Conclude your weekend on a happy note with your loved ones at the Sunday Brunch. The Afternoon Tea experience at Tiqri is just the beginning of a promising evening ahead. With an array of recipes paired with hot brews, the menu captures tantalizing flavours synonymous with Mumbai street food. Offering unmatched spirited experiences with a stellar collection, Tiqri Bar Lounge is a swanky addition to the restaurant. Adding to the culinary repertoire, China Inc, our Chinese specialty restaurant offers an authentic Sichuan and Cantonese fare while Rivea, our Italian specialty restaurant brings to the table refined flavours from the shores of Italy.<br><br>

					<b>-</b> Take your delight quotient up a notch with the elegantly furnished rooms and suites that help you rediscover bespoke luxury. The Presidential, Grande Luxury, Luxury and Junior Suites as well as the Taj Club and Luxury Rooms pride themselves on being the largest of their kind in the city.<br><br>

					<b>-</b> In keeping with the design theme, the Ballroom and Imperial room at the hotel, reserved for celebratory and corporate events alike, amalgamate sheer functionality and technological expertise with aesthetic appeal and grandeur. And if, after all of this, your senses still crave stimulation or solace, holistic wellness awaits your arrival at the world-renowned Jiva Spa.

					<b>-</b> Symbolic of all that is Mumbai, Taj Santacruz will permanently etch this city as a treasured memory.</p>
